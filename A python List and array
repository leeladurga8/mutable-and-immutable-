List and array are used to store data as datastructures.
List: A list is a data structure in python is mutable that has an ordered sequence of elements
example:list=[1,2,3,4]
print(list)

Array: an array is a data structure that holds data in a linear format,array holds fixed number of elements.
we have to import array module to declare arrary
Example: import array as arr
sample_array = arr.array("i",[1,2,3,4])
print (sample_array)
