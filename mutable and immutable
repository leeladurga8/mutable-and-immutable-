Mutable and Immutable objects in python
Mutable objects: whenever object is initiated ,it is assigned a unique object id .the type of object is defined at runtime and cannot 
be changed at run time .how ever if the state of the object is changed it is called mutable objects.
Lists are mutable in python.we can add and remove elements from the list .
Example : Add and remove items from a list in python.
A list in python is mutable ,list provides the methods such as append(),insert(),extend(),remove(),and pop().
my_list=[1,2,3,4]
my_list.append(7)
my_list.pop(2)
my_list.insert(6,8)
my_list.remove(4)
Immutable objects in python:whenever the object is initialised,once the object is created ,however it 
cannot be changed is called immutable objects.
Example :we will take tuple and try to do modify at the particular index, as tuple is an 
immutable object.It throws an errorwhen we try to modify it.
tuple1=(0,1,2,3)
tuple1[0]=4
